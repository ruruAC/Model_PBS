# Model_PBS
This project is to solve the workshop scheduling problem in the 2022 ‘Huawei Cup’ Mathematical Modeling Competition.

The automotive manufacturing industry is advancing rapidly, with an increasing number of manufacturing companies seeking an intelligent production model for scheduling and control of automobile production in their workshops. We address the scheduling strategy problem for the intelligent PBS (Painted Body Store), which is the buffer sequencing area for automotive manufacturing, by leveraging Markov decision processes, temporal-difference methods, trust-region policy optimization, Monte Carlo methods, and more. Specifically, we focus on the scheduling of inbound and outbound transverse conveyors for vehicle movement.

We have developed and solved a scheduling strategy model for PBS and implemented it using Python programming. This solution effectively addresses the dynamic scheduling challenges of PBS, aiming to meet and enhance production requirements and system efficiency.
